<h1> problems faced</h1>
<ul> 

<li> Finding out how to use math.floor and math random in it's intended purpose.</li>

<li> Using queryselector to write an outcome into the html document from the end results of a function. </li>

<li> Saw that array would add on to previous password result output and had to find out what was going on and a way to clear the valid = []; each time the function started </li>

</ul>
